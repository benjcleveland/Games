Assigment 7 - Created a website for my boardgame collection where people can review all the board games that I currently own.
Assignment 8 - Did some code cleanup (forms, urls, and template inheritance)  and added top 10 list by user.  Also added a page to play around with the team cowboy api.

See about page on website for additional information.
